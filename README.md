# COLD (California Online Directory)

Goal: Redesign the current statewide online directory to fit Design System principles and improve UX.

Parallel Products: We will need to scope out both an internal (staff only) facing portal and an external (public) facing portal.

Discovery: In order to begin the design process, we need to conduct user research and a full audit of the existing site. Discoverable items:

What is currently broken or feels unfinished in the site?
Why do users visit the site?
Where are users coming from? Are they coming in from other sites?
What do users do when they visit the site? How are they traversing the site?
How is the current site serving or not serving user needs?
Is the site accessible?
What kind of navigation friction exists?
What kind of restrictions/regulations exist around PIIs (Privately Identifiable Information)? Example: Can we share the email of a judge or law enforcement staff?
Any other questions that pop up: the unknown unknowns

During the discovery phase, we will begin creating user personas/archetypes and build user journeys to test various product hypotheses. This will help us create a strong design validation process going forward. 

Broader discovery: We need to know who all stakeholders are and what larger goals there are.
